**swift-prefect-snippets** is a collection of code snippets for Perfect development. And since Visual Studio Code already provides support Swift and Perfect, this extension is all you need to start coding.

Perfect is a complete and powerful toolbox, framework, and application server for Linux, iOS, and macOS (OS X). It provides everything a Swift engineer needs for developing lightweight, maintainable, and scalable apps and other REST services entirely in the Swift programming language for both client-facing and server-side applications.
